# NetworkDiag-tool

Version: 0.2

Simple network diagnostic programme using a pipe function I made for personal use.

The point is to put a few commands you might use to diagnose your network all in one place for convenience.

(Press enter after each command)

All commands listed are in order.

Commands:

- ping

- arp -a

- ipconfig
